Game Name: Battleship

Authors: Daniel Mallia and Jayson Tan

Start Date: 2/28/2019

Personal Statement: This is a personal project for the both of us to learn the
basics of JavaScript while having fun! Some of the logic and thought process behind
this game is inspired by the JavaScript Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial by FreeCodeCamp:

Run Instructions and Notes: 
- Game starts on window open and can be restarted with the replay button.
- Ships are of size/length two, and can only be placed in vertical or horizontal orientations,
  just like the original board game ;)
- Enjoy!
